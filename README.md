## Important Considerations for 1-Month Launch

This accelerated timeline represents an aggressive approach that prioritizes speed to market with a minimal viable product. Key points to keep in mind:

1. **Scope Management**: The plan focuses on core functionality only - you'll need discipline to avoid scope creep
2. **Technical Debt**: Expect to accumulate some technical debt that will need to be addressed post-launch
3. **Integration Depth**: Initial integrations will have limited depth, focusing on most-used features
4. **Team Resources**: This timeline assumes you have adequate development resources already in place
5. **Post-Launch Support**: Be prepared for a heavy focus on support and rapid iterations post-launch

With this approach, you'll get to market quickly with a basic version of DevUnify that demonstrates your vision while allowing for rapid improvement based on real user feedback.
